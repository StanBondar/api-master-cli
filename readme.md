This package will help you to generate an express router TypeScript bundle in a single moment.
It can be started only from the project directory or from any of its subdirectories.
The package will create a router bundle in your API folder and will update the API entry point.
If the API folder doesn't exist - it will be created automatically.

Just run js-cli_package route_name, where "route_name" is your desired route name.
