This package will help you to generate an express router TypeScript bundle in a single moment.
It can be started only from the project directory or from any of its subdirectories.
The package will create a router bundle in your API folder and will update the API entry point.
If the API folder doesn't exist - it will be created automatically.

### Installing api-master-cli

With NPM:

```bash
npm i -g api-master-cli
```

#### Usage

Just run api-master-cli <route_name>, where "route_name" is your desired route name. All methods will be generated by default. Pluralize package handles all route names for better naming.

You can choose only methods you want to generate by typing its names separated by dash(-). 

I.e. api-master-cli <route_name> get-put. In this case only get and put methods will be generated. If you made a mistage in method name - it will be skipped. If all methods will be provided with mistakes, the default methods bundle will be created.
