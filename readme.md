This package will help you to generate an express router TypeScript bundle in a single moment.
It can be started only from the project directory or from any of its subdirectories.
The package will create a router bundle in your API folder and will update the API entry point.
If the API folder doesn't exist - it will be created automatically.

### Installing api-master-cli

With NPM:

```bash
npm i -g api-master-cli
```

#### Usage

Just run api-master-cli <route_name>, where "route_name" is your desired route name.
